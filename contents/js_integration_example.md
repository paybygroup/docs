## Sample Implementation

#### Part 1 - Informational Unit(s)

Add an informational unit using any of the copy and design examples listed in the LINKDesign GuidelinesLINK on one or more of the following pages:

•   Homepage
•   Search results page
•   Product listing page

You may customize the look and feel to match your site as long as the IMAGELINKPayByGroup LogoIMAGELINK is included whenever the term "PayByGroup" is used.

When clicked, the informational unit displays the lightbox explaining how PayByGroup works, and the only option on the lightbox is to close it and keep browsing.

<div class="alert tip">
  <p>The key parameter that defines these divs as informational units is <code>data-button-action="close"</code> .</p>
</div>

No other data attributes need to be defined for the informational units, though you can customize it if you like.

Here is an example of an informational unit:

#### Part 2 - Use PayByGroup Option

Place the option to use PayByGroup at the earliest point on your site where the total cost is available - including all taxes, fees, and options. This will typically be on the first page of your checkout process.

<div class="alert tip">
  <p><strong>Tip</strong>: This is where you should be sure to set the data attributes listed above and any additional ones you want to include</code> .</p>
</div>

Here is an example of the option to use PayByGroup where the button has been styled to match the merchant's existing site:
