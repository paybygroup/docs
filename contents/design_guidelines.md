## Highlighting PayByGroup Features

These guidelines cover the recommended practices for adding the PayByGroup option to your website. They are based on lessons gathered from our clients who have maximized the value of adding PayByGroup to their business and thereby increased their sales conversion rates to very high levels.

Three key principles guide the most effective implementations:

1.	**Early awareness:** make users aware early in your site that PayByGroup is an available payment option, long before they leave without purchasing 

2.	**Continuous context:** provide context at each key decision point on your site to let users know where/when in your funnel they will be given the option to choose PayByGroup

3.	**Available when they need it:** make the option to use PayByGroup available as early in the funnel as possible, in addition to placing it on the checkout page, which is a point where non-PayByGroup businesses typically lose many conversions

## Early Awareness

Including a note on your homepage or primary landing page that shows PayByGroup is available on your site accomplishes three things:

1.	Highlights your offerings as well-suited for use or purchase by multiple people

2.	Shows that you are sensitive to the challenges your users face and are willing to provide the tools and extra-mile service needed to make their experience with your business even better

3.	Immediately disarms users’ concerns about how they will cover the cost

## Continuous Context
As users browse through your site they typically encounter search results, product pages, and one or more checkout steps such as a shopping cart and agreement page. At each of these points, a user that needs PayByGroup is deciding whether to continue through the purchase process. 

If they are aware you offer PayByGroup, they are wondering when the option will be available. Unfortunately users’ attention spans are too short to rely on their remembering what you told them on the previous page so you have to remind them. 

If they aren’t aware you offer PayByGroup and you don’t inform them at each step in the funnel, then the users that need it will abandon your site before they have a chance to start a purchase on your site via PayByGroup.

##Available When They Need It

There are two places where users expect PayByGroup to be available as an option:

<dt>1.  As soon as the total cost is clear </dt>

<dd>a.	This is a significant drop-off point for many businesses </dd>

<dd>b.	PayByGroup is able to get users to continue a purchase they otherwise would have abandoned

<dt>2.	On the checkout page

<dd>a.	Because users are accustomed to options with “Pay” in the name to be found on the checkout page, many of them look for the PayByGroup option here 

For merchants with a single checkout page, which also serves as the first place the total cost is displayed, these two locations are the same. In those cases, that page is where PayByGroup should go.

For other merchants that have a quote page or a widget that displays the total cost on the product page or a shopping cart page before the checkout, these locations differ. For those merchants the option to choose PayByGroup should be available in both locations.

The best way to present the option at the checkout step is by asking users whether they want to split the cost OR complete the booking themselves. For the users that need to get others on board, presenting an either/or option makes it seem like a trusted option offered by the merchant and not an unknown, risky option.
